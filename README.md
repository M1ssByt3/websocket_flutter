# WebSocket Demo Flutter Application

A simple Flutter application demonstrating WebSocket communication using the `web_socket_channel` package.

## Overview

This application allows users to send messages to a WebSocket echo server and receive the echoed responses. It demonstrates real-time bidirectional communication between a client and server using WebSockets.

## Features

- Connect to a WebSocket server (`wss://echo.websocket.events`)
- Send text messages to the server
- Receive and display echoed responses from the server
- Clean resource disposal when the app is closed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest version recommended)
- An IDE (Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, etc.)
- A device or emulator to run the app

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## How It Works

The application establishes a WebSocket connection to an echo server that returns any message sent to it. When a user types a message and presses the send button, the message is sent to the server via the WebSocket connection. The server then echoes the message back, which is displayed in the UI.

## Code Structure

- `main.dart`: Contains the complete application code
  - `MyApp`: Root application widget
  - `MyHomePage`: Stateful widget that manages the WebSocket connection
  - `_MyHomePageState`: State class containing the WebSocket channel and UI components

## Future Improvements

1. **Connection Status Indicator**: Add a visual indicator showing the current connection status (connecting, connected, disconnected).

2. **Message History**: Implement a scrollable message history to display all sent and received messages.

3. **Custom Server Configuration**: Allow users to configure and connect to different WebSocket servers.

4. **Message Formatting**: Support for different message formats (text, JSON, binary) with appropriate display formatting.

5. **Authentication Support**: Add capability to authenticate with WebSocket servers that require it.

6. **Reconnection Logic**: Implement automatic reconnection when the connection is lost.

7. **Offline Mode**: Add offline capability with message queuing for later transmission.

8. **Message Typing Indicators**: Show when the other end is typing or processing a message.

9. **Multi-user Support**: Extend the application to support chat rooms or multiple participants.

10. **Notifications**: Add push notifications for messages received when the app is in the background.

## Dependencies

- [web_socket_channel](https://pub.dev/packages/web_socket_channel): For WebSocket communication.
